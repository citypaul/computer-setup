# New Mac setup

This repo will automatically setup a new mac so I don't have to go through the faff of installing and configuring everything each time I need to setup a new computer.

To run, it should just be a case of running `./install.sh`

## To setup the iterm theme

The Dracula iterm theme at this point in time still needs to be installed manually through the iterm gui. [Follow these instructions to complete the installation](https://draculatheme.com/iterm).

The theme is cloned into `~/dracula.iterm-theme`.
